								<h2 class="font-secondary">General Outline</h2>
									<span>As a student at Rochester Institute of Technology, I have taken a variety of computer courses, ranging from basic networking concepts, to being able to detect certain types of cyber security attacks as they are happening. Through the combination of my didactic course work and my current job experience, I have been able to gain comfortability with concepts such as Active Directory, Group Policy Objects, Windows Servers and Operating Systems, Linux Operating Systems, Docker, cyber security tools, etc. If you are an employer, you can probably find a few of the main classes I have taken on my resume, but I wanted to expand on that in this section. Below is an expanded insight on the course work that I have taken that has helped me throughout my coursework. </span>
